658. Setting Up Flask Project
create first environment for the project
virtualenv env hit enter
then  cd .\env\Scripts\
 --  .\activate hit enter it willl activate env

building this huge and complex Budget tracker application,
let's first basic setup which would be required for our Flask application.

whenever you want to create a flask application, you need to go ahead and create an app.py file

659. Creating Route To Accept Data

 this particular expense manager or budget tracker application, what we want to do is
 want to accept the expenses which are made by the user.
if you go out to a movie and you spend a bunch of money on movie tickets

660. Creating Form

every expense would obviously have the date
because date is important to know when exactly you have made that particular expense
another filed name of expensive
 next thing which is important is the amount of expense which you made.
 another field and the final field is going to be an expense category,
 which basically states what kind of category this expense belongs to.
  these are the different values which we need to accept from the user.



661. Styling The Form


662. Getting Values From The Form

handling the submission of this particular form which we have created.

663. Creating A Database Model
 we need install first Flask SQL Alchemy as well as the SQL Alchemy Packages.

 pip install SQLAlchemy

 pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy

 RuntimeError: Working outside of application context, indicates that you're trying to access Flask's features
 (like the database) without the proper application context being set up.

from app import app, db
>>>
>>> with app.app_context():
...     db.create_all()
